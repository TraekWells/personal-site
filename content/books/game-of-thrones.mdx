summary: A gripping epic fantasy of power, intrigue, and family.
review: "Wow, what a ride. I've read this many years ago but after this re-read, I think it's the best fantasy book I've ever read. The character depth, the politics and the fighting are all incredible. Oh and my god, THE WORLDBUILDING is unlike anything I've ever read. Tremendous. Winter is coming."
