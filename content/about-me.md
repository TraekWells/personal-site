I feel that I have the best job in the world. I get to combine my love for technology with inner calling of being creative. On top of all of that, I get to work with people and bring their visions of a digital product to life.

Like most other designers, as a kid I was fairly artistic. I wanted to be a concept artist for a major video game company because I thought drawing was my passion. Fast forward until I graduated college with a graphic design degree and started to teach myself how to code, and my life would forever change for the better.

Since then, I've dedicated myself to becoming the best designer and front-end developer possible. I'm inspired by great work and great people and I truly working with people to transform ideas into real, interactive prodcuts that users love.

## Professional values

### Always put the user first

The primary goal of a website is to solve a problem for a user or offer a solution to a problem they have. That's why it's **critical** to always have the user in mind when going through the design and development phases of a project.

### Trends come and go, but good design remains the same

Everything moves at lightspeed in the design and development world. There's always a new _something_ to learn and that will likely always be the case.

What remains consistent though is applying the core design principles to your work. A good design is

- Understandable
- Visually pleasing
- Usable
- and most importantly, **user-focused**

### Celebrate small wins

Life is full of ups and downs. Make sure to celebrate the ups when you're on them.

## Fun stuff about me

Serious stuff aside, I'm a regular person who doesn't take life too seriously. We're only on this planet for a short amount of time so I want to spend that time doing things that make me and my loved ones happy.

- I was born in Iowa but was raised in Minnesota where I currently reside.
- Besides a concept artist, I also used to want to be a zoologist out of my love for wildlife.
- Neptune is my favorite planet because I read somewhere that if we could stand on it, it would be like standing on jello. I thought that was pretty cool.
