I feel that I have the best job in the world. I get to combine my love for technology with inner calling of being creative. On top of all of that, I get to work with people and bring their visions of a digital product to life.

Like most other designers, as a kid I was fairly artistic. I wanted to be a concept artist for a major video game company because I thought drawing was my passion. Fast forward until I graduated college with a graphic design degree and started to teach myself how to code, and my life would forever change for the better.

Since that moment, I've dedicated myself to becoming the best designer and front-end developer possible. I'm inspired by great work and I truly working with people to transform ideas into real, interactive prodcuts that users love.

## Professional values

### Always put the user first

### Celebrate small wins

## Fun stuff about me

Serious stuff aside, I'm a regular person who doesn't take life too seriously. We're only on this planet for a short amount of time so I want to spend that time doing things that make me and my loved ones happy.

- I was born in Iowa but was raised in Minnesota where I currently reside.
- Besides a concept artist, I also used to want to be a zoologist out of my love for wildlife.
- Neptune is my favorite planet because I read somewhere that if we could stand on it, it would be like standing on jello.
