## The Client

Chet Merino is a wellness coach and the owner of Prime Wellness, a small business built around optimizing your life physically, spiritually and mentally. He originally started out as a personal trainer, helping people reach their goals in regards to fitness. That led him to discover his true passion, helping people optimize their health, holistically.

He needed a website that give him a place to market his services and to attract clients. Prime Wellness offers two primary services:

1. Wellness coaching
2. Public speaking engagements

## The Goal

After a great discovery meeting, I learned a lot about the brand and which aspects of it were the most important to spotlight in the design. Even though wellness coaching was the primary service, offering to speak publicly for companies was another important aspect of his business.

High-level goals for the website included:

- Building a simple design with a generous amount of white-space
- A contact form for potential clients to reach out
- Dedicated pages for each service offered by the business

## The Result

Chet was super happy with the finished website when he received it. It was responsive and looked great on all devices and it made great use of white-space which was important to the brand.

The two primary services have dedicated pages which go into great detail about each service along with giving the user a way to contact the business.

It was important that he was able to make changes to the content so I opted to build his site in WordPress.
