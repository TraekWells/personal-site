Got through an incredibly uneventful month where the only thing I have to show is an injured foot that seemingly came out of nowhere. The dog is slowly ruining our yard but the baby is doing barrel rolls across the floor so that‚Äôs cool to watch.

## Wins

Not really any wins to report here. March in Minnesota is basically the equivalent of being an NPC in SimCity where the overloads throw in random weather events. I‚Äôll call that a win because I like a little randomness.

Boring but good month.

## Losses

I did something to my foot this past month so it put a **serious** damper on my running. I literally did nothing in March that required me to put a lot of weight and pressure on my feet. This is easily the slowest healing injury I‚Äôve ever had.

## Recap

üìú Blogs Written:

Ziltch, but made great progress on two longer posts. Excited to share those next month.

üìñ Books Read:

* **WILL**: A memoir from Will Smith. I‚Äôm a gigantic fan of this man and hilariously, I finished his book the same day he smacked Chris Rock. **A very** embarrassing moment for Will but his memoir was a great read. It was a bit heavy-handed with the braggy parts of basically every chapter, but _if_ you can get over that, there‚Äôs a lot to take away from it.
* **Ring Shout**: [P. Dj√®l√≠ Clark](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=APq-WBt8Lzi0m6x1_7hvst1ZHUXGZI4gGA:1649473759694&q=P.+Dj%C3%A8l%C3%AD+Clark&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NMwyTCrLyCnPVoJyDQory83TSrRkspOt9JPy87P1y4syS0pS8-LL84uyrRJLSzLyixaxCgToKbhkHV6Rc3itgnNOYlH2DlbGXexMHAwAVLZ7-VkAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ8ozMgIb3AhVaG80KHazMBoAQmxMoAXoECGQQAw) might be my new favorite author. While I didn‚Äôt love [The Black God‚Äôs Drum](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38118138-the-black-god-s-drums), I did love [A Master of Djinn](https://traekwells.com/bookshelf/a-master-of-djinn) and I loved Ring Shout too. It‚Äôs essentially a fantasy/horror take on the KKK and hate-breeding hate. A short read, filled with action and a creative take on monsters.

I started reading ‚ÄúThe Mis-Education of the Negro‚Äù but stopped reading it because I found it **incredibly** boring.

üêú Other Stuff Did:

* Made good progress on my basement, I think I‚Äôll be ready to move down there at the end of April

## Goals for next month

* Two blog posts
* Start running again
* Establish a writing habit
