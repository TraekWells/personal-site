Got through an incredibly uneventful month where the only thing I have to show is an injured foot that seemingly came out of nowhere. The dog is slowly ruining our yard but the baby is doing barrel rolls across the floor so that’s cool to watch.

## Wins

Not really any wins to report here. March in Minnesota is basically the equivalent of being an NPC in SimCity where the overloads throw in random weather events. I’ll call that a win because I like a little randomness.

Boring but good month.

## Losses

I did something to my foot this past month so it put a **serious** damper on my running. I literally did nothing in March that required me to put a lot of weight and pressure on my feet. This is easily the slowest healing injury I’ve ever had.

## Recap

📜 Blogs Written:

Ziltch, but made great progress on two longer posts. Excited to share those next month.

📖 Books Read:

* WILL
* Ring Shout

I started reading “The Mis-Education of the Negro” but stopped reading it because I found it **incredibly** boring.

🐜 Other Stuff Did:

* Made good progress on my basement, I think I’ll be ready to move down there at the end of April

## Goals for next month

* Two blog posts
* Start running again
* Establish a writing habit
