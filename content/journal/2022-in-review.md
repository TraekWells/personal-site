## 🐜 Personal Life

### Family

Family is doing great. I'm extremely grateful that everyone is healthy, happy and we all seem to like each other. Whenever someone asks me how I feel about being a father, I always tell them that the first year is the hardest and it's _smooth_ sailing after that. Well, I've slighly adjusted my stance on that. My daughter is in the first grade and she's already a smart-a\*\*. She likely gets it from me so I can't be mad and it's slightly hilarious but also slightly difficult.

## 🌮 Health & Fitness

### Fitness

One of my major goals last year was to run my first marathon. I'm happy to say that I accomplished that goal and I plan on doing another one at some point (although not next year). The best thing about completing the marathon wasn't the actual race but it was the training. I lost a good amount of weight and my body doesn't seem to have any issues with maintaining that weight.

### Health

I started doing jui-jitsu in 2022 and while I absolutely love it, damn it's hard on the body. Between the ligament strain and micro-fractures, this is for sure the most injury-ridden I've ever been. Jui-Jitsu is something I see myself in for the long haul. I'm a very competitive person and this sport is great for that. Nothing like one on one combat for fun right?

## 👨🏾‍💻 Career

Not really much to say here. I started a new job at the beginning-ish of last year and it's very treating me well. Being both a Front-end developer and a UI designer is a strange thing for a few reasons:

- What do we call ourselves? UI Developer? UX Developer? Front-end developer? Some kind of engineer? Does anyone _really_ care?
- How do you stay on top of the latest design trends and best practices while also staying up to date on the newest development technology?
- Can someone really be **great** at both or do we have to _lean_ towards one or the other?

Anyways, I absolutely adore what I do and if I had the option to be in any other profession, I would stay put right here. _But I would try to find a way to be a Zoologist on the side_.

### Freelancing

I've freelanced off and on for years now. Never in an official capacity but I've been open to helping out friends or friends of friends. Towards the end of 2022, I've started to get more serious about having a legit side hustle and freelancing is going to be it. My full-time job and my hobbies are going to take priority over freelancing but it'd be good to get some extra projects in when I can.
