In previous years, the shortest month of the year seems to always be the most unproductive for me. This past one was no different but this time around, I’m not bummed about it.

## Wins

### Reading

This reading train is still ongoing and doesn’t seem to be slowing down. I’m absolutely loving my time spent reading and look forward to eventually getting to the massive amount of books I have saved for later.

I’m not sure if it’s a placebo or not but since I’ve been reading basically every day, I **feel** smart and I **feel** like I’m remembering better. I guess whether it’s a placebo or not, the fact that I’m _feeling_ it is good enough for me.

### Health

I lost quite a few pounds in February and I’m getting close to my goal weight of 185.

## Losses

### Writing

I didn’t do any writing this past month. However, I did attend a few writing-focused meetups. I took a massive L in the writing department.

Saying that I still have lofty writing goals.

### Current Affairs

The World is in a constant state of sadness. Especially if you watch the news or go out looking for bad stuff. One might say, “Well just don’t watch the news.” Not a bad point but that doesn’t change the fact that bad things still happen around the world.

Since becoming a father five years ago, my number one priority has been to set my kids up for success. I worry that World will not give my kids a fair shot at it. It appears that the more time that passes, the worse things seem to get and my kids will have to navigate this strange environment.
