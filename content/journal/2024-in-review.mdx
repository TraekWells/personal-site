I realized I never wrote a 2023 in review but 2024 has already come to a close and here I sit, another year where I'm not really sure what I've accomplished. That may sound a bit self-deprecating but I tend to expect a lot from myself.

Let's start by reviewing what I wanted to based off my previous goals:

- **Wake up early (5AM)** ‚ùå: I missed the mark on this one. I was in a groove for a solid three weeks but man o' man do I like sleeping. One issue I have with this is finding a good bedtime. We put the kids down around 8:30 so that leaves me the options of 1) Going to bed to wake up early or 2) stay up and have some quality me time. I'll always choose the latter so waking up early cuts into my sleeping hours.
- **Fast for 16 hours a day** ‚ùå: This didn't happen. Fasting does wonders for me mentally and physically but given that I did more running last year than usual, I skipped this more that I would have liked to admit.
- **Write at least 500 words per day** ‚ùå: Way off here.
- **Mediate a few times per week** ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: This wasn't consistent but meditation has become a part of my mornings, on most mornings. Something about just sitting in silence makes the entire day better. Sounds like science-fiction but I swear it makes me smarter for that day.

## Personal

The older and older I get, the more and more I appreciate everything about the world. 2024 was a year that really allowed me to dial in my ability to be in the moment. Even if the world is burning all around me and my family, I still have them and that's important to me.

### Music

Music continues to be a rock in my life. It grounds me, keeps me level headed and gives me a new appreciation for the weirdness of the universe. I discovered quite a bit new artists last year, some of my favorites including:

- **Dylan Gossett** (folk)
- **Sam Barber** (folk I think)
- **Jason Isbell** (folk maybe?)
- **Zach Bryan** (country)
- **BigXThePlus** (rap)

### Health

Something I take for granted is overall health. I injured my groin in the beginning of October and still to this day, it's not healed. I _think_ I'm ok and it's nothing series but holy moly is it easy to forget that being healthy is an amazing state to be in.

I can't tell you how eager I am to get back to running.

## Professional

### YouTube

I started a YouTube channel and posted a whopping **two** videos on it. But hey, I'm really proud of those two videos and I plan on posting a lot more. There's a lot of work involved in creating a YouTube video that was a reality check for me.

### Skills

Part of me thinks my skills have remained stagnant over the course of last year. I had a busy year at my full-time job so the skills I had, have remained sharp. One thing I can say is that I'm a better thinker when it comes to architecting large projects. That was something I lacked in the past so I guess that's something.

## Goals for 2025

This time I'm going to jot down some more realistic goals:

- **Wake up between 5 and 6 in the morning**:
- **Fast for 16+ hours most days of the week**:
- **Post two YouTube videos per month**:
- **Update my impossible list**:
