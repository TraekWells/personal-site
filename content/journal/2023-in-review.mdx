I realized I never wrote a 2023 in review but 2024 has already come to a close and here I sit, another year where I'm not really sure what I've accomplished. That may sound a bit self-deprecating but I tend to expect a lot from myself.

Let's start by reviewing what I wanted to based off my previous goals:

- **Wake up early (5AM)**: I missed the mark on this one. I was in a groove for a solid three weeks but man o' man do I like sleeping. One issue I have with this is finding a good bedtime. We put the kids down around 8:30 so that leaves me the options of 1) Going to bed to wake up early or 2) stay up and have some quality me time. I'll always choose the latter so waking up early cuts into my sleeping hours.
- **Fast for 16 hours a day**: This didn't happen. Fasting does wonders for me mentally and physically but given that I did more running last year than usual, I skipped this more that I would have liked to admit.
- **Write at least 500 words per day**: Way off here.
- **Mediate a few times per week**: This wasn't consistent but meditation has become a part of my mornings, on most mornings. Something about just sitting in silence makes the entire day better. Sounds like science-fiction but I swear it makes me smarter for that day.

The older and older I get, the more and more I appreciate everything about the world. 2024 was a year that really allowed me to dial in my ability to be in the moment.

## Professional

## Goals for 2025

This time I'm going to jot down some more realistic goals:
