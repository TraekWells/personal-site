title: Impossible List
summary: An impossible list is a catalog of challenges that you have given yourself.
  Unlike a bucket list which is static and gets smaller as you complete the items,
  an impossible list will grow and evolve with you as you live.

Ever since I came across <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Frank’s impossible list</a> I knew I had to make one for myself. He got the idea from a dude named <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Runyon</a> who I believe is the founder of impossible lists.

I’ll be 100% honest here, I took a lot of Thomas Frank’s goal categories because they were great categories quite frankly (no pun intended). Almost every productive person has goals that they want to achieve, but putting them somewhere public will not only hold you accountable but also keep you reminded of what you’re aiming for.

Let's get this party started.

## Current Focuses

I'm working on improving my User Interface and User Experience design skills while simultaneously trying to learn Vue 3 and vanilla JavaScript more deeply (doing both is difficult).

I'm also in a constant battle with imposter syndrome and it's a back and forth battle. At the moment, I'm winning and feeling pretty confident but it comes and goes.

Lastly and always, I'm working on becoming a better person and appreciating the moment as much as I can.

Similar to who I got the idea from, I would encourage you to create your own impossible list. It’s kind of difficult to come up with goals off of the top of your head, at least it was for me, so I would recommend checking out Thomas’ or taking goals from this one. I think it’s ideal to have it somewhere digital but there’s nothing wrong with paper and pencil too. Just make sure you account for adding sub-goals and even sub-categories.
