Anyone else finding it weirdly depressing that there's always this phantom feeling of guilt when you're not actively working on something? Like this there's mysterious judge who's watching you and counting the _things_ that you got done? Maybe it's this huge uptick of hustle culture, but it feels like we're always supposed to doing _something_ or else we're falling behind.

Even if we **are** falling behind (which we probably aren't), is that a terrible thing? I'm not sure.

## Why?

Why is it that when I'm out on a run, I'm thinking about work, or ways to make money on the side, or ways to impress my peers? Can't I just enjoy being in nature and listening to the birds, the wind and the water?

Why is it that when I'm reading a book, I'm thinking about the next book I should be reading, or how I can apply the knowledge I'm learning to my work? Can't I just enjoy the story and the characters?

Is it possible to have a truly clear mind and to just be existing?

## Competition

If I had to bet my last dollar on it, I would say it's because of the hyper-competitive world we live it. If we're not working, we're falling behind. If we're not learning, we're falling behind. If we're not hustling, we're falling behind and the next person is going to take your spot.

Where does the time to slow down and relax come in? Does it exist? Am I lazy if I do?

Oh well, it's strange being a human.
