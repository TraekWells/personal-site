January was great. It’s likely due to the normal “New year, new me” that everyone gets but I really do feel like a new me. I didn’t make the mistake of setting resolutions for the year because every time I do, I either:

* Lose track of the goal
* Don’t do the goal I set

One of the biggest things I’ve learned about goals is that you have to avoid the temptation of making the goal too grand in the beginning. It makes sense too. The goal you’re trying to set likely is a new behavior or metric you want to hit. To expect yourself to hit that goal right away is unrealistic. Also, I’m not sure about you but I like seeing progress. Whenever I set a goal that’s too big and I don’t see progress, it’s very demoralizing.

Anyways.

Random note, I decided I’m retiring from fantasy football. I don’t need that stress in my life anymore.

## Wins

### Alcohol

I managed to go the entire month of January without drinking a single drop of alcohol. That was an item on my [impossible list](https://traekwells.com/journal/impossible-list) so it feels pretty good to check one-off. It was surprisingly easy, but I do enjoy a nightcap after a large meal. I must say, I feel like my head is **super** clear which is great.

### Reading

Another win, if you ask me is how much I’ve been reading. Like I’ve mentioned a million times (at least it feels like a million times to me) is that I bought a Kindle recently and I’ve been reading like a madman. Loving it. I’ve been finding a ton of new books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143010468-traek-wells) which I’m also loving.

I’ve never been much of a ‘highlight in my books’ kind of guy so I’m doing my best to do a short [write-up of the books I’ve finished](https://traekwells.com/bookshelf) here. This has been helping me remember what I read and pay more attention to what I’m reading.

### Diet (not eating)

My biggest win this month was my diet for sure. I just ate less overall.

## Losses

Not too many losses to report here. I’m working on building an office in my basement and I planned on working on it. Turns out, I literally did nothing down there.
