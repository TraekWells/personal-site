## 📕 What It's About

Robert Langdon is a professor at Harvard University professor who specialized in art history and symbology. One day he wakes up in a hospital in Italy, from an apparent attack, with no recollection of how he got there. While he's regaining consciousness, someone attempts to kill him **in the hospital**.

He narrowly escapes with the help of his doctor named Sienna Brooks. He finds out that someone super powerful and insanely smart has created and planted some kind of biological **thing** that will seemingly fix Earth's ever-growing population problem.

The person who created this **thing** sent a video to a powerful organization explaining how they're going to fix that problem and made a lot of references to Dante Alighieri's _The Divine Comedy_, specifically the first chapter titled _Inferno_.

Robert and Sienna both race to decipher a bunch of clues in the video in order to stop this destructive thing from happening.

## 🔍 How I Discovered It

I've read a few of Dan Brown's books and for the most part, I enjoy them. His work is fast-paced, mysterious and I always end up learning something new about history.

After I finished reading _Angels & Demons_ a while ago, this book was recommended to me and I purchased it right away.

## 🧠 Thoughts

_Inferno_ is a great, thrilling page-turner with some killer quotes in it. Here are some of my favorites:

> The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.

> Nothing is more creative … nor destructive … than a brilliant mind with a purpose.

> The worst kind of loneliness in the world is the isolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose their grasp on reality.

If you've read any other Dan Brown book, _Inferno_ basically follows the same formula. That makes this interesting because if it's the first Dan Brown book you've ever read, there's a high chance you'll think highly of it. On the flip side, if you've read a number of other books by Dan, you might find it boring.

### What I Liked About It

This book was **very** **exciting,** to say the least. I couldn't wait to start reading it again the next day and it's because it's so fast-paced with pretty short chapters.

I love books with short chapters.

Another thing I liked about _Inferno_ is that the problem that the antagonist was trying to fix in this book, felt very real. In reality, the overpopulation of the planet scares me quite a bit. So when a **fictional** character comes up with an extreme solution to fix a real problem, it almost makes you feel more invested in it.

### What I Didn't Like About It

I found it odd that the person who created this thing that would basically kill a bunch of people would leave so many clues as to where to find the thing they created.

## 🦉Who Would Like It?

If you're a fan of Dan Brown, this book is essentially more of the same, which may or may not be for you.

This book would be great for people who like to read high-paced thrillers and suspense. One thing this book does extremely well is keeping you reading. There were many, many times when I said I'd read for 30 minutes only to end up reading for an hour and a half.

Also, anyone who's read _The Divine Comedy_ and enjoyed it will find **a lot** of references to it here.
