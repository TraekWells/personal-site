## 📕 What It's About

In the previous book, Alabaster tapped into the power of the obelisks and tore a giant rift in the continent, exposing a drastic amount of geological stuff and triggering the current ‘Fifth Season’.

Elsewhere, we learn that Essun’s husband Jija, beat their son Uche to death after learning that he was an orogene. Jija then takes their daughter Nassun and leaves town. _The Obelisk Gate_ begins with Jija and Nassun going north to a town that her father believes has the ‘cure’ for orogeny.

Essun is trying to find her daughter while also trying to understand more about the obelisks, and Alabaster is dying.

## 🔍 How I Discovered It

Immediately after finishing [_The Fifth Season_](https://traekwells.com/bookshelf/the-fifth-season)_,_ I purchased _The Obelisk Gate_ and the last book of the trilogy, _The Stone Sky._ The first book was so damned good, finishing the trilogy was automatic for me.

## 🧠 Thoughts

_The Obelisk Gate_ was a bit boring when compared to [_The Fifth Season_](https://traekwells.com/bookshelf/the-fifth-season/). The reason is that I **feel** like not much happened. It’s a very slow book compared to the first in the series. Also, there was a lot of information thrown at you in this book.

All of that to say, I still enjoyed it, I absolutely love the characters and their development, and I’m very much looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.

### What I Liked About It

I loved how we finally get to learn more about Essun’s daughter, Nassun. She didn’t get very much page-time in the first book but she’s basically featured in half of _The Obelisk Gate_. Her orogeny powers are rapidly growing and I suspect there’s going to be a showdown between her and her mother.

Another thing I liked about _The Obelisk Gate_ is that we’re finally learning more about these mysterious ‘things’ called the stone-eaters. They were still surrounded by a mist of wonder after the first book and now the reading is beginning to get an understanding of their purpose and motives. Although they differ from stone-eater to stone-eater it seems.

Also, I **love** Alabaster and Schaffa. I think they’re great characters. These two have been the highlight of the series for me so far.

### What I Didn't Like About It

As I eluded to earlier, _The Obelisk Gate_ is boring at times. There were times where I’d read a large paragraph and thought to myself, “I could have just skipped that.” That’s really the only complaint I have.

## 🦉Who Would Like It?

If you loved the first book, you **have** to read this one as well.
