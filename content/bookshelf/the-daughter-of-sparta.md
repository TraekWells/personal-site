thoughts: I'm a huge Greek mythology nerd so I was excited for this one. Ultimately,
  it fell flat for me and it was a bit on the corny side but cool to see a female
  protagonist.

## Who's this book for?

Anyone who's interested in Greek mythology and is looking for an original spin on the Gods, Goddesses, and heroes would probably enjoy this book.

It's a bit heavy-handed with the romance scenes, which is not at all my cup of tea, so the reader should expect that.
