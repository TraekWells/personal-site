I love a good fiction book to take me out of real-life for a while and _The Fifth Season_ is one of my new favorites.

It's about 'beings' living on a supercontinent called the Stillness. Every couple of centuries, the planet goes through what they call The Fifth Season and is basically a planet-resetting cataclysmic event.

To add to that, these 'beings' live in a caste system ranging from hard laborers to magic-wielding 

## Impressions

## Favorites

Of the reviews of this book that were negative, just about all of them had an issue with the switching of the reader's point of view. Honestly, that was one of my favorite aspects of _The Fifth Season_.

## Who's this book for?

People who love science fiction and fantasy would absolutely love this book. As I mentioned previously, there's an interesting thing going on with the changing of the reader's point of view which I thought was great but some reviewers didn't like.
