Once I got about halfway through _The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,_ I knew it would be a book that I read many times. In fact, I liked it so much that I got a copy for a good friend of mine.

## Impressions

## Favorites

There's a chapter in the book titled "Happiness is Learned" which is a personal favorite of mine. In this chapter, he talks about how being unhappy is really just humans with desires they haven't achieved yet. One passage in particular:

> Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.

## Who's this book for?

I'm convinced anyone on the face of this planet would benefit from reading this book. Literally anyone. If there's someone **not** on the face of this planet, we would be wise to learn their language and translate it for them.
