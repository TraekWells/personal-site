Once I got about halfway through _The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,_ I knew it would be a book that I read many times. In fact, I liked it so much that I got a copy for a good friend of mine.

Eric Jorgenson has compiled snippets from Naval's articles, tweets, podcasts, and essays and put them in a readable, book format. \[For free I might add\](First, this book has an interesting structure to it. It's broken down into two distinct parts, Wealth and Happiness.).

## Favorites

I enjoyed the second half of the book titled "Happiness" much more than the first half. I think it's because happiness is much more important to me than building wealth is.

> The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their imporantance is reverse.

There's a chapter in the book titled "Happiness is Learned" which is a personal favorite of mine. In this chapter, he talks about how being unhappy is really just humans with desires they haven't achieved yet. One passage in particular:

> Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.

## Who's this book for?

_The Almanack of Naval Ravikant_ is for anyone curious about building wealth and training the skill of happiness. This is an absolute goldmine for both big picture and practical ideas about optimizing your mind to live a happier, more fulfilled life.

Naval states that building wealth is a skill just like riding a bike is a skill. It's something you can get better at by applying certain principles and focuses.

I'm convinced anyone on the face of this planet would benefit from reading this book. Literally anyone. If there's someone **not** on the face of this planet, we would be wise to learn their language and translate it for them.
