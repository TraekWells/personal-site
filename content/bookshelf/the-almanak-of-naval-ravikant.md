Once I got about halfway through _The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,_ I knew it would be a book that I would read many times. In fact, I liked it so much that I got a copy for a good friend of mine.

This book is organized into two parts, Wealth and Happiness. Eric Jorgenson has compiled snippets from Naval's articles, tweets, podcasts, and essays related to each part and put them in a readable, book format.

The best part? [It's available for free](https://www.navalmanack.com/).

## Impressions

Easily one of the best books I've ever read. If I was the kind of reader who highlighted books, the whole book would be highlighted. That's not an exaggeration. There are **sooo** many nuggets in this book.

I will keep this book around to re-read and reference in the future.

## Favorites

I enjoyed the second half of the book titled "Happiness" much more than the first half. I think it's because happiness is much more important to me than building wealth is. (I'm also better at being happy).

> The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.

There's a chapter in the book titled "Happiness is Learned" which is a personal favorite of mine. In this chapter, he talks about how being unhappy is really just humans with desires they haven't achieved yet. One passage in particular:

> Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.

In the "Wealth" part of the book, there's a chapter titled "Building Judgement". There's a line that I read over and over again and it's really stuck with me:

> It's only after you're bored you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, or busy, running aronud or rushed. Make the time.

I can relate to that 100% and it's **mostly** true for me. My best ideas seem to come when I'm either:

1. Doing nothing and I'm bored just like Naval mentions, or
2. In a state of suffering through exercise

## Who's this book for?

_The Almanack of Naval Ravikant_ is for anyone curious about building wealth and training the skill of happiness. This is an absolute goldmine for both big picture and practical ideas about optimizing your mind to live a happier, more fulfilled life.

Naval states that building wealth is a skill just like riding a bike is a skill. It's something you can get better at by applying certain principles and focuses.

I'm convinced anyone on the face of this planet would benefit from reading this book. Literally anyone. If there's someone **not** on the face of this planet, we would be wise to learn their language and translate it for them.
