Back when I was a new designer and I had a web design project to tackle, my typical first steps were to start deciding on colors, typefaces, and how the overall grid would look. Hell, I might have even started to pick out some images.

Even though I **was** taught that it‚Äôs critical to start every serious design project with user research, wire-framing, defining the problems, etc.. (all of the ‚Äòboring‚Äô stuff to me as a new designer), it was, and still kind of is, **very** tempting to skip the building blocks and go directly to the detailed visuals.

It wasn‚Äôt until later in my career that I realized I was setting myself up for failure by not establishing a strong foundation.

<aside> üìù Note: If you‚Äôre designing a side project for yourself, it might be ok to skip straight to the visuals. But for serious design projects that will potentially have a lot of users or if the design is for a client, set the project up for success by establishing a strong foundation by focusing on the user experience first. Make it beautiful afterwards.

Here are the key areas I recommend you focus on **before** getting into the finer, visual details such as color, imagery, animations, which framework you‚Äôre going to use, and why it‚Äôs going to be React. (Kidding, I love react).
