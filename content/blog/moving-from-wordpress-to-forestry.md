This is not an anti-WordPress post

I've been using WordPress for quite a while for any website or project that had any kind of blog-like content. It was my go-to Content Management System (CMS) because it gives you everything you could possibly need to begin creating and manage content out of the box. That's probably why \[it's so popular\]([https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/ "https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/")).

But as a wise person once said (or maybe I just made this up):

## What is Forestry?

\[Forestry.io\]([https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/")) is a Git-based headless CMS that allows you to manage markdown content with a truly beautiful editing experience.

## Why Make The Switch?

I found this neat little npm package

\[Convert your exported WordPress content to Markdown files \]([https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown "https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown"))
