<small>This is not an anti-WordPress post</small>

I've been using WordPress for quite a while for any website or project that had any kind of blog-like content. It was my go-to Content Management System (CMS) because it gives you everything you could possibly need to begin creating and manage content out of the box. That's probably why [it's so popular](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/ "WordPress popularity").

But as a wise person once said (or maybe I just made this up):

> When you recieve **everything**, don't forget, that includes all of the bloat

## What is Forestry?

[Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry io") is a Git-based headless CMS that allows you to manage markdown content with a truly beautiful editing experience.

## Why Make The Switch?

I found this neat little npm package

[Convert your exported WordPress content to Markdown files](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown "Convert your exported WordPress content to Markdown files") and I love it.
