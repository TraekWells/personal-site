## Professional Life

I work as a UX Designer at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/) and it's a great place to work. I get very nice blend of both front-end development and design tasks to do. I'm grateful that my work pushes my skills and allows me to grow as a professional.

## Personal Life

Trying to find my purpose and be the best husband and father I can be.

## Working On

## Reading

Black Mouth by Ronald Malfi.

## Listening to

A lot of Hozier at the moment. Can't get enough of [Wasteland Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/4qpvDzPCm5PLNLNINaEWM5?si=LMj3yAqiQjmGNTRfkaRdLw)

## Watching

Ruruni Kenshin ðŸ”¥
