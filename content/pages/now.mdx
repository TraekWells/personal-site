### Musical Escapades

I picked up and started learning the guitar during COVID and it's been one hell of journey learning this thing. It's difficult as all hell but extrememly rewarding. I started on acoustic because I love the way they sound, but finally, more than three years later, I bought an electric guitar.

The best part about it is that the sound is so much more clear so I can **really** hear how bad I am.

This past christmas, my daugher bought me a harmonica and I've been learning that as well.

I'll be playing at gigs in no time. ü•≤

## Studying CSS

There's a been a lot of new CSS features lately so I'm trying to catch up with them. One of the goals of this very site is to use it as a place to experiment with stuff.

## ü§î What's next?

### Probably going to re-design this website again

Because why the hell not?
