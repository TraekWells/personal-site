## Short Story

I feel that I have the best job in the world. I get to combine
my love for technology with inner calling of being creative.
On top of all of that, I get to work with people and bring
their visions of a digital product to life.

Like most other designers, as a kid I was fairly artistic. I
wanted to be a concept artist for a major video game company
because I thought drawing was my passion. Fast forward until I
graduated college with a graphic design degree and started to
teach myself how to code, and my life would forever change for
the better.

Since then, I've dedicated myself to becoming the best
designer and front-end developer possible. I'm inspired by
great work and great people and I truly enjoy working with people to
transform ideas into real, interactive prodcuts that users
love.
