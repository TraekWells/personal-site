This will allow them to get to the content they came for faster.","Breaking the standard conventions is acceptable if it will improve the user experience.","Let’s take navigation as an example. The navigation of a website is almost always the first thing the users see, and for good reason. It’s critical to display what content is available on that website right away. Most navigation follows this design pattern:","Logo in the upper left (sometimes centered in its own row)","Clicking on the logo will bring the user back to the homepage","Search, account information, settings, etc. in the upper right","Navigation items somewhere in the middle","Here are a some examples:","Runner's World navigation","\u002Fimg\u002Frunners-world-navigation.png","Runner's World navigation example","Pocket navigation","\u002Fimg\u002Fpocket-navigation.png","Pocket navigation example","CSS Tricks navigation","\u002Fimg\u002Fcss-tricks-navigation.png","CSS Tricks navigation example","Users are familiar with this design.

The answer to this question should guide you in the right direction in the design process and allow you to focus on key areas such as:","The overall message of the product","Call to action placement","General content flow","\nProviding a design solution to a problem is your primary job as a designer. Really spend the time here and make sure that the problem is well defined.\n","The second most important question to answer in the design process is who you’re solving the problem for. Who’s going to be using the product you’re designing?","This is what we call ","User Research","This step involves communicating with the people who will be using, or in the case of a redesign, who are ","already"," using the product, and trying to figure out what problems they have with it.","A common mistake is assuming that ","you"," are the user that the design needs to have a solution for.

Ideas come with time.","The reason designing in grayscale is so effective is because it adds a temporary constraint to the project.

If you’re anything like me, you’ll get ideas while you’re exercising, in the shower, sleeping, or beekeeping.

Building off of my last tip about wireframing multiple ideas, more than likely, the client will prefer a few ideas from different wireframes. After receiving feedback, you can then combine their preferences into the final design.","Another benefit to getting feedback, preferably early in the design process, is that the client will be aware of the general design direction before it's too late in the design process.","Feedback is an invaluable tool and it's critical to digest and apply it in the early stages of the design process.

For some strange reason, as a younger designer, I thought that professionals just had all of these ideas in their heads. I’ve come to learn that everyone uses inspiration to spark new ideas.","Here is a list of my favorite places to go to find design inspiration:","https:\u002F\u002Fnicelydone.club\u002Fpatterns\u002F","Sourcing images can be extremely time-consuming. In this stage of the design process, I highly recommend using light or dark boxes in the place where an image would be instead. This will allow you to take up the space a real image would, while still allowing you to focus on the bigger picture (no pun intended) and overall layout.","This is last on this list because it’s not always necessary to begin a project with paper and pencil and I don’t always start that way. The obvious benefit of starting with these analog tools is the pure speed at which you can sketch out ideas.","It’s very easy to sketch out a large rectangle and start placing the important elements where you think they should go. This is great because you get a high-level overview of the design hierarchy, balance, scale, and general alignment.","No computer is needed at this step.","Remember, it’s your primary job as a designer to come up with a design solution to a problem. That is what makes design different than art. Art is self-expression. Design is using creativity to solve a problem.","Design is difficult. It becomes increasingly difficult if you’ve already ‘finished’ the design but the problem isn’t solved and you have to re-think your solution.","I hope you enjoyed the read."))
