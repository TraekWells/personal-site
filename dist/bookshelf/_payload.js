Djinn are very clever with their words, can take the shape of a human or an animal, and can practice free will. They can be evil or good.

They weren’t super deep and complex but they were very interesting. The mechanical angels, Ahmed the high priest of Sobek, Siti the lioness and follower of Sehkmet, and Hadia, Fatma’s partner who turns out to me be a badass.","Another thing I liked was the pacing. It didn’t feel too fast or too slow.","The ending was lackluster to me. Throughout the whole book, you start to get an understanding of how powerful and destructive these mysterious things called The Ifrit are. They've been asleep for a mighty long time and they can easily bring the World to dust.","But when the protagonist is finally confronted by them, she lives? I have to mention that Fatma is a mortal, she’s just a human being.","I found it hard to believe that she would live through meeting them.","Then again.. it ","is"," a science-fiction, fantasy novel about djinn, magic, and angels.","Ahmad. The high priest of Sobek was a great character and my favorite. He’s mysterious, weird, and would randomly pop up out of nowhere to check in on Fatma and her progress with the mission (which he had a vested interest in).","As the book progressed, Ahmad slowly started getting crocodilian features which further added to his mystique. Easily a standout character for me.","“Unlike the young,” Khalid continued, “I know the difference between what I want, what I need, and what might just kill me.","The world sits at a precipice.

I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It has vulgar language and a few nasty pictures. Personally, I like that he's being himself but I can understand how it wouldn't be for everyone.","He's accomplished some incredible things for a human being. Seemingly impossible things actually. I don't want to be like Goggins at all but I do want the armor he has on his mind. From the outside, it appears as if he's immune to suffering and I want that.","I discovered David Goggins through the Joe Rogan Experience. I suspect a lot of people discovered David that way. He's been a repeat guest at this point and his message really resonates with me.","Suffering and it's been extremely beneficial to my life. That ","used"," to sound weird to me but when someone as hard as David Goggins comes along and says that we should not only embrace suffering but seek it out, it became less weird.","I don't take it nearly as far as David does but I had to read his book.","This book is for anyone who needs a kick in the ass to get going. What David Goggins went through to get where he's at is proof that we can overcome and conquer our minds.","This isn't a how-to-be-tough book but it's more of proof that you can build an iron will one step at a time.","I talk to myself "," during runs, especially when I get tired. This isn't new for me as I've always done this, but the words that I'm using have changed after reading this book. Stuff like: \"The mind is weak, the body is not. I'm a warrior.\"","I take control of the inner dialogue that goes on in my mind when I'm doing difficult stuff a lot more nowadays. I know that my mind wants to quit and having that awareness gives me a bigger sense of how it could limit me if I give in.","In life, there is no gift as overlooked or inevitable as failure.","We have access to so many more resources today than ever before and yet we are so much less capable than those who came before us. If you want to be one of the few to defy those trends in our ever-softening society, you will have to be willing to go to war with yourself and create a whole new identity, which requires an open mind.","There is no more time to waste. Hours and days evaporate like creeks in the desert. That's why it's okay to be cruel to yourself as long as you realize you're doing it to become better. We all need thicker skin to improve in life. Being soft when you look in the mirror isn't going to inspire the wholesale changes we need to shift our present and open up our future.","Robert Langdon is a professor at Harvard University professor who specialized in art history and symbology.

Here are some of my favorites:","The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.","Nothing is more creative … nor destructive … than a brilliant mind with a purpose.","The worst kind of loneliness in the world is the isolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose their grasp on reality.","If you've read any other Dan Brown book, "," basically follows the same formula. That makes this interesting because if it's the first Dan Brown book you've ever read, there's a high chance you'll think highly of it. On the flip side, if you've read a number of other books by Dan, you might find it boring.","This book was ","very"," ","exciting,"," to say the least. I couldn't wait to start reading it again the next day and it's because it's so fast-paced with pretty short chapters.","I love books with short chapters."," is that the problem that the antagonist was trying to fix in this book, felt very real. In reality, the overpopulation of the planet scares me quite a bit. So when a ","fictional"," character comes up with an extreme solution to fix a real problem, it almost makes you feel more invested in it.","I found it odd that the person who created this thing that would basically kill a bunch of people would leave so many clues as to where to find the thing they created.","If you're a fan of Dan Brown, this book is essentially more of the same, which may or may not be for you.","This book would be great for people who like to read high-paced thrillers and suspense. One thing this book does extremely well is keeping you reading. There were many, many times when I said I'd read for 30 minutes only to end up reading for an hour and a half.","Also, anyone who's read "," and enjoyed it will find "," of references to it here.","There’s a team of biologists, led by twin sisters Inti and Aggie, who go to the Scottish Highlands to introduce wolves to the ecosystem. The hope is to re-balance the wildlife to allow crops to grow freely, restoring the land.","As you might expect, the people of the Scottish Highlands aren’t too accepting of releasing wolves into their home. Most of them have farms and raise animals, which would be targeted by the newly introduced wolves.","As the story is told, you learn a lot about Inti and Aggie’s past and you learn that they are also running from a ","VERY"," dramatic experience back home. The move to Scotland is as much for them as it is the Highlands.","One late night, a towns member is brutally murdered. It appears as though the town member was attacked by an animal. Everyone except for the biology team suspects the wolves did the crime.","The biology team isn’t so sure.","Inti is adamant that wolves only attack if provoked and it’s their nature to be timid of humans. Humans are the ones that hunt wolves. Humans are the ones that destroy the wolves’ habitat.","She’s going to do whatever it takes to protect the wolves from the blame and the hunt that would surely follow.","But, if the wolves didn’t kill the member of the town, who did?","For the most part, this was an enjoyable book. The beginning ","really"," captured me and had me turning pages like a mad man. But towards the end, it slowed down quite a bit and the reveal wasn’t ","super"," surprising. To be fair, it did surprise me, but I was hoping for more.","I love the author Charlotte McConaghy’s writing style. It’s elegant, beautiful, and explains nature in a way that puts extra emphasis on its magic.","My favorite aspect of "," is the descriptions of nature. It’s clear that Charlotte has a love for nature and it’s reflected in her writing of this book. Here are a few of my favorite passages from the book:","I am such a simple meal; I have no speed with which to run, no strength to fight her off. My skin is disastrously thin. Does she know this about me? Can she sense it, as the others of her kind don’t seem to? They are fooled by the power in our voices and our weapons, by our ability to cage them.","My father used to say the world turned wrong when we started separating ourselves from the wild, when we stopped being one with the rest of nature, and sat apart. He said we might survive this mistake if we found a way to rewild ourselves. But I don’t know how to do that when our existence frightens the creatures we must reconnect with.","That’s beautiful.","Something else that I loved about this book is that the wolves are very intertwined with the story. Almost so that each pack feels like they are individual characters themselves. Seeing that this is a mystery book about a murder, the wolves are never glossed over as an afterthought.","My only issue was with the ending of the book. One of the main characters has something terrible happen to them by another main character, and they kind of just ","get over it",". That was strange.","This book is for readers who enjoy mystery mixed with a little bit of romance. "," is very environmentally conscious and does a "," job of giving the reader something to think about the book is finished.","Something is feeding off the Sun and it’s getting dimmer at a rapid pace. Eventually, it will lose enough energy that it will cause massive extinctions on Earth and give the human species ","all kinds of problems","The story starts off with Ryland Grace waking up in a strange place that he eventually learns is a spaceship.. in a different star system. Slowly, through a series of flashbacks, he starts to piece together what happened and more importantly, why he’s on this spaceship in the first place.","This book was amazing. I didn’t find it too similar to "," like most reviews said, but I did notice a formula between the two. It was absolutely thrilling throughout the entire book and it somehow made me feel good (and maybe even a little excited) for alien life.","Andy Weir is great in this lane. It’s easy to tell that he does a ton of research before delivering his science-fiction novels.","I couldn’t put this book down. It’s the second time Andy has done that, the first time with "," and it’s because of his writing style. He writes as if he’s talking and it makes it super easy to digest and understand. There are a lot of good writers out there, but Andy shines in his ability to put you in the character’s shoes and really feel what’s going on around them.","Hail Mary"," is very heavy-handed with science references. I’m a nerd, so I enjoy reading about measurements, space specifications, and biology.. but it was a bit much for me. Like I previously mentioned, this book was an easy read so it wasn’t terrible but it was one of the few flaws that stood out.","ROCKY",". Rocky was the alien robot that Grace met while in orbit of Tau Ceti. As time goes on, the two of them start to exchange languages and meaning in their respective cultures. Eventually, they good pretty damn good at communicating together and Rocky, being the alien that it is, doesn’t have human characteristics and says stuff bluntly.","And it’s great.","My favorite parts were basically every part where Grace and Rocky were interacting. Andy Weir did an amazing job of creating humor and entertainment out of Grace trying to explain why and how humans do human things to Rocky. Sleep for example.","If you liked ",", you’ll 100% love this book. In all honesty, I feel that anyone who’s even remotely interested in the science-fiction genre would absolutely love ",". It’s thrilling, a somewhat short read, and the pacing is great.","You will never become rich by trading your time for your money. The only way to financial freedom is by finding a way to make money while you sleep. (or win the lottery).","Happiness is a choice you ","can"," and ","should"," make.","The time you have on this amazing planet is super short so don't waste your time doing things that don't make you happy.","Once I got about halfway through ","The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,"," I knew it would be a book that I would read many times. In fact, I liked it so much that I got a copy for a good friend of mine.","This book is organized into two parts, Wealth and Happiness. Eric Jorgenson has compiled snippets from Naval's articles, tweets, podcasts, and essays related to each part and put them in a readable, book format.","The best part? ","It's available for free","I don't remember exactly how I discovered it but I first heard of Naval on the Joe Rogan Experience. It was one of my favorite podcasts and it was one that I re-listened to a few times over.","Then I came across ","https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fnaval\u002Fstatus\u002F1002103360646823936","this famous tweetstorm"," and it was so profound that I really started to dig into this man."," is for anyone curious about building wealth and training the skill of happiness. This is an absolute goldmine for both the big picture and practical ideas about optimizing your mind to live a happier, more fulfilled life.","Naval states that building wealth is a skill just like riding a bike is a skill. It's something you can get better at by applying certain principles and focuses.","I'm convinced anyone on the face of this planet would benefit from reading this book. Literally anyone. If there's someone ","not"," on the face of this planet, we would be wise to learn their language and translate it for them.","Did I mention you can ","read it for free","?","The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.","Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.","A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lost their innate peace.",5," is book one in the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K. Jemison.","It's about 'beings' living on a supercontinent called the Stillness. Every couple of centuries, the planet goes through what they call a Fifth Season and is basically a planet-resetting cataclysmic event.","Society is based on a caste system. There's a wide spectrum of roles ranging from laborers to magic-wielding orogenes who can control the energy in the ground to the strangely powerful Guardians to keep the orogenes in check.","The story follows three female orogene protagonists named Essun, Damaya, and Syenite, each at a different point in their life although they seem to be heading in a similar direction."," randomly popped up as a recommended book on Amazon while I was browsing for new material to read. It was mentioned that this novel won the Hugo award in 2016. If you're unaware, the Hugo award is given to the best fantasy or science-fiction of the previous year. It's basically the Grammy for this genre of books."," brought back my love for reading fiction. I've been on a non-fiction kick for a few months now but there's nothing like a good story to take you out of the real world for a while.","Something that stood out to me was how grim and dark this book felt as I was reading it. I assume it's because of the re-occurring cataclysmic events but the world is in a post-apocalyptic-esk setting and everything just feels grimey and cloudy.","Lastly, I hope this turns into a TV show. N. K. Jemison's built an incredible world on paper and I couldn't imagine how fantastic it would be on screen.","All of the characters were great but I particularly loved Shaffa. He's a guardian who escorted Damaya to the Fulcrum to learn the ways of orogeny. While he's escorting her, you learn how hard of a 'being' Shaffa is. He's an interesting blend of ruthlessness and comforting.","I loved how the book shifted to a second-person point of view when describing the story for Essun. It's not something that I've come across before and it kept my mind curious about what was going on.","This book takes ","originality"," to an extreme. This is easily the most original book I've ever read with a unique kind of magic.","The last quarter or so of "," really makes it hard to put the book down. You start to build this connection with all three protagonists and the ending is absolutely flawless.","I wish more time was spent in the Fulcrum. The Fulcrum is where orogenes learn how to control their powers and they progress through ranks. It's a Hogwarts of sorts.","People who love science fiction and fantasy would absolutely love this book. As I mentioned previously, there's an interesting thing going on with the changing of the reader's point of view which I thought was great.","N. K. Jemisin","\nContains spoilers\n","In the previous book, Alabaster tapped into the power of the obelisks and tore a giant rift in the continent, exposing a drastic amount of geological stuff and triggering the current ‘Fifth Season’.","Elsewhere, we learn that Essun’s husband Jija, beat their son Uche to death after learning that he was an orogene. Jija then takes their daughter Nassun and leaves town.

Also, there was a lot of information thrown at you in this book.","All of that to say, I still enjoyed it, I absolutely love the characters and their development, and I’m very much looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.","I loved how we finally get to learn more about Essun’s daughter, Nassun.

Her orogeny powers are rapidly growing and I suspect there’s going to be a showdown between her and her mother."," is that we’re finally learning more about these mysterious ‘things’ called the stone-eaters.

These two have been the highlight of the series for me so far.","As I eluded to earlier, "," is boring at times.
