There's a wide spectrum of roles ranging from laborers to magic-wielding orogenes who can control the energy in the ground to the strangely powerful Guardians to keep the orogenes in check.","The story follows three female orogene protagonists named Essun, Damaya, and Syenite, each at a different point in their life although they seem to be heading in a similar direction."," randomly popped up as a recommended book on Amazon while I was browsing for new material to read.

I assume it's because of the re-occurring cataclysmic events but the world is in a post-apocalyptic-esk setting and everything just feels grimey and cloudy.","Lastly, I hope this turns into a TV show. N. K. Jemison's built an incredible world on paper and I couldn't imagine how fantastic it would be on screen.","All of the characters were great but I particularly loved Shaffa. He's a guardian who escorted Damaya to the Fulcrum to learn the ways of orogeny. While he's escorting her, you learn how hard of a 'being' Shaffa is. He's an interesting blend of ruthlessness and comforting.","I loved how the book shifted to a second-person point of view when describing the story for Essun. It's not something that I've come across before and it kept my mind curious about what was going on.","This book takes ","originality"," to an extreme. This is easily the most original book I've ever read with a unique kind of magic.","The last quarter or so of "," really makes it hard to put the book down. You start to build this connection with all three protagonists and the ending is absolutely flawless.","I wish more time was spent in the Fulcrum. The Fulcrum is where orogenes learn how to control their powers and they progress through ranks.

I thought it was good but it didn’t pull me in like "," did.","This one is much more up my alley. A mash-up of mechanical angels, djinn, Egyptian mythology, and magic. What’s not to love here? Speaking of the djinn, in particular, I loved how they were presented.","Folks who aren’t into Islamic folklore would probably assume a djinn is like the genie from ","Aladdin",". Djinn are very clever with their words, can take the shape of a human or an animal, and can practice free will. They can be evil or good. "," did a splendid job of showing a wide variety of djinn possibilities.","All in all, this was a very enjoyable read and will probably be one of my favorites based solely on the subject matter."," has some ","great"," characters. They weren’t super deep and complex but they were very interesting. The mechanical angels, Ahmed the high priest of Sobek, Siti the lioness and follower of Sehkmet, and Hadia, Fatma’s partner who turns out to me be a badass.","Another thing I liked was the pacing. It didn’t feel too fast or too slow.","The ending was lackluster to me. Throughout the whole book, you start to get an understanding of how powerful and destructive these mysterious things called The Ifrit are. They've been asleep for a mighty long time and they can easily bring the World to dust.","But when the protagonist is finally confronted by them, she lives? I have to mention that Fatma is a mortal, she’s just a human being.","I found it hard to believe that she would live through meeting them.","Then again.. it ","is"," a science-fiction, fantasy novel about djinn, magic, and angels.","Ahmad. The high priest of Sobek was a great character and my favorite. He’s mysterious, weird, and would randomly pop up out of nowhere to check in on Fatma and her progress with the mission (which he had a vested interest in).","As the book progressed, Ahmad slowly started getting crocodilian features which further added to his mystique. Easily a standout character for me.","“Unlike the young,” Khalid continued, “I know the difference between what I want, what I need, and what might just kill me.","The world sits at a precipice. Our ability to create has exceeded our ability to understand.","“No one knows,” Maker put in. “My predecessor had nefarious designs for its intent. I fear little else from this imposter. Leader is correct, the machine should be … unmade.” The last word sounded almost foreign to her.","This last line stood out to me because there’s a mechanical angel named Maker. One can assume that their life is dedicated and revolves around ","making"," things. Creating things. P. Djèlí Clark did a great job displaying invoking empathy here.","If you’re even remotely interested in Egyptian mythology and are up for a good mystery book, this is for you. It’s not often that you get a book that’s filled with djinn and they certainly shine in ",".",4,"ol","You must not only embrace suffering, but you must seek it out to callus the mind.","Most people are living their lives to bout 40% of their maximum potential.","The untrained mind is very weak and will quit on you ","much"," quicker than the body.","As a fan of David Goggins and his savageness, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It has vulgar language and a few nasty pictures. Personally, I like that he's being himself but I can understand how it wouldn't be for everyone.","He's accomplished some incredible things for a human being. Seemingly impossible things actually. I don't want to be like Goggins at all but I do want the armor he has on his mind. From the outside, it appears as if he's immune to suffering and I want that.","I discovered David Goggins through the Joe Rogan Experience. I suspect a lot of people discovered David that way. He's been a repeat guest at this point and his message really resonates with me.","Suffering and it's been extremely beneficial to my life. That ","used"," to sound weird to me but when someone as hard as David Goggins comes along and says that we should not only embrace suffering but seek it out, it became less weird.","I don't take it nearly as far as David does but I had to read his book.","This book is for anyone who needs a kick in the ass to get going. What David Goggins went through to get where he's at is proof that we can overcome and conquer our minds.","This isn't a how-to-be-tough book but it's more of proof that you can build an iron will one step at a time.","I talk to myself ","a lot"," during runs, especially when I get tired. This isn't new for me as I've always done this, but the words that I'm using have changed after reading this book. Stuff like: \"The mind is weak, the body is not. I'm a warrior.\"","I take control of the inner dialogue that goes on in my mind when I'm doing difficult stuff a lot more nowadays. I know that my mind wants to quit and having that awareness gives me a bigger sense of how it could limit me if I give in.","In life, there is no gift as overlooked or inevitable as failure.","We have access to so many more resources today than ever before and yet we are so much less capable than those who came before us. If you want to be one of the few to defy those trends in our ever-softening society, you will have to be willing to go to war with yourself and create a whole new identity, which requires an open mind.","There is no more time to waste. Hours and days evaporate like creeks in the desert. That's why it's okay to be cruel to yourself as long as you realize you're doing it to become better. We all need thicker skin to improve in life. Being soft when you look in the mirror isn't going to inspire the wholesale changes we need to shift our present and open up our future."))
