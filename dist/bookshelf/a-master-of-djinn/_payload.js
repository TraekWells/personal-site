Speaking of the djinn, in particular, I loved how they were presented.","Folks who aren’t into Islamic folklore would probably assume a djinn is like the genie from ","Aladdin",".

It didn’t feel too fast or too slow.","The ending was lackluster to me.

I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It has vulgar language and a few nasty pictures. Personally, I like that he's being himself but I can understand how it wouldn't be for everyone.","He's accomplished some incredible things for a human being. Seemingly impossible things actually. I don't want to be like Goggins at all but I do want the armor he has on his mind. From the outside, it appears as if he's immune to suffering and I want that.","I discovered David Goggins through the Joe Rogan Experience. I suspect a lot of people discovered David that way. He's been a repeat guest at this point and his message really resonates with me.","Suffering and it's been extremely beneficial to my life. That ","used"," to sound weird to me but when someone as hard as David Goggins comes along and says that we should not only embrace suffering but seek it out, it became less weird.","I don't take it nearly as far as David does but I had to read his book.","This book is for anyone who needs a kick in the ass to get going. What David Goggins went through to get where he's at is proof that we can overcome and conquer our minds.","This isn't a how-to-be-tough book but it's more of proof that you can build an iron will one step at a time.","ul","I talk to myself "," during runs, especially when I get tired. This isn't new for me as I've always done this, but the words that I'm using have changed after reading this book. Stuff like: \"The mind is weak, the body is not. I'm a warrior.\"","I take control of the inner dialogue that goes on in my mind when I'm doing difficult stuff a lot more nowadays. I know that my mind wants to quit and having that awareness gives me a bigger sense of how it could limit me if I give in.","In life, there is no gift as overlooked or inevitable as failure.","We have access to so many more resources today than ever before and yet we are so much less capable than those who came before us. If you want to be one of the few to defy those trends in our ever-softening society, you will have to be willing to go to war with yourself and create a whole new identity, which requires an open mind.","There is no more time to waste. Hours and days evaporate like creeks in the desert. That's why it's okay to be cruel to yourself as long as you realize you're doing it to become better. We all need thicker skin to improve in life. Being soft when you look in the mirror isn't going to inspire the wholesale changes we need to shift our present and open up our future.","Robert Langdon is a professor at Harvard University professor who specialized in art history and symbology. One day he wakes up in a hospital in Italy, from an apparent attack, with no recollection of how he got there. While he's regaining consciousness, someone attempts to kill him ","in the hospital","He narrowly escapes with the help of his doctor named Sienna Brooks.

His work is fast-paced, mysterious and I always end up learning something new about history.","After I finished reading ","Angels & Demons"," a while ago, this book was recommended to me and I purchased it right away."," is a great, thrilling page-turner with some killer quotes in it. Here are some of my favorites:","The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.","Nothing is more creative … nor destructive … than a brilliant mind with a purpose.","The worst kind of loneliness in the world is the isolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose their grasp on reality.","If you've read any other Dan Brown book, "," basically follows the same formula. That makes this interesting because if it's the first Dan Brown book you've ever read, there's a high chance you'll think highly of it. On the flip side, if you've read a number of other books by Dan, you might find it boring.","This book was ","very"," ","exciting,"," to say the least. I couldn't wait to start reading it again the next day and it's because it's so fast-paced with pretty short chapters.","I love books with short chapters.","Another thing I liked about "," is that the problem that the antagonist was trying to fix in this book, felt very real. In reality, the overpopulation of the planet scares me quite a bit. So when a ","fictional"," character comes up with an extreme solution to fix a real problem, it almost makes you feel more invested in it.","I found it odd that the person who created this thing that would basically kill a bunch of people would leave so many clues as to where to find the thing they created.","If you're a fan of Dan Brown, this book is essentially more of the same, which may or may not be for you.","This book would be great for people who like to read high-paced thrillers and suspense. One thing this book does extremely well is keeping you reading. There were many, many times when I said I'd read for 30 minutes only to end up reading for an hour and a half.","Also, anyone who's read "," and enjoyed it will find "," of references to it here."))
