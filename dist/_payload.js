Although he was new to marketing himself online, he had a pretty large following on other social media platforms. The website that he wanted would need to have the ability to be easily updated at will.","More importantly, he stressed that since he’s a professional photographer, he would need a way to organize, display and edit photography projects to promote his work.","The goal was to create a beautiful, functional website where Emeche could showcase his photography, artwork, blog and basketball journey. Seeing that he was new to website maintenance, it was also a goal of mine to make the website very easy to update as his brand gets more established.","When it came to creating the photography projects on the site, I really wanted to make it as easy as humanly possible.","Seeing that he’s also a blogger, having a well laid out display was an absolute must. I thought that by staggering the size of blog posts, it would help the reader scan blogs that they might want to read. Also, this would would very well on smaller devices.","Emeche’s new website is 100% responsive on all devices. It’s clean, professional and reflects Emeche’s personality. The focus of the new site was the blog posts so that is featured at the top of the homepage with an interesting layout to capture attention.","I’ve spoken with him since the launch and he’s glad that the photography section is super easy to add, remove and edit projects.","Being the good friend that I am, I offered to build something that would help solve these problems knowing that it would take skills that were ","JUST"," outside of my skillset. This would force myself out of my comfort zone and test my problem solving skills.","From the beginning, my plan was to use "," since I'm infatuated with that framework. Everything about it just makes sense to me. That's not to say that I'm an expert in it, because I'm "," from it, but Vue just calls to me.","Besides leveraging the Vue ecosystem, I did have a few specific goals that I wanted to accomplish for this project.","I wanted to user to select their favorite reading genres and ping some API with a query of those genres to keep things fresh and unique per user","I wanted to use Tailwind CSS for the first time so I could see what the hype was about","The user needed to be able to save books ","somewhere","The user needed to be able to save the books that they read and review them","Most importantly, finish the damn project","This was a challenging project for me. Things didn't go ","exactly"," as planned, although I barely planned at all (more on this later).","My original intention was to use local storage to handle keeping the books organized, but I quickly realized that it local storage couldn't handle what I wanted to do with this project. I ended up using Google Firebase since I had ","some"," familiarity with it.","Learning how to use Google Firebase wasn't necessarily a challenge but it introduce a bunch of new issues I had to work out. Some of these included:","User authentication","Data structuring","Updating specific instances of data in the database","Querying data","I came out of the project with a newfound appreciation for JavaScript frameworks, specifically Vue in this case. This would have taken a Herculean effort if it was written in vanilla JavaScript.","The fact that I was building this project for someone besides myself to use, it drove me to consider much more use cases. This allowed me to focus on making the User Experience (UX) as good as possible.","I barely planned at all for this project. I kind of just jumped in and started coding which led to a handful of headaches. I am ","SO"," much more efficient if I have a clear plan of action before I dive into the code. I spent way too much time adjusting Tailwind classes to get things to look at least a little bit as I was picturing it.","A typical workflow for me looks something like this:","Open Spotify and turn on Lofi Hip Hop or Otis Redding","I'll sketch a "," rough layout (","This might literally be just one box containing other boxes",")","Open up ","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sketch.com\u002F","Sketch"," and add some life, color and structure to it","Open up VS Code and go on my merry way trying to implement the design","This list is super high-level and there's normally a few more steps but the point is, typically, I'll have a design that I'm trying to build.","This time, I thought I'd try to \"design in the browser\" and skip the design phase.","From reading on Twitter, it seems that some people can do this effectively but I've learned that this doesn't work for me. I get fixed on making the most un-important aspect of a design perfect, which takes away time from actually getting the ","thing"," built.
