Although he was new to marketing himself online, he had a pretty large following on other social media platforms. The website that he wanted would need to have the ability to be easily updated at will.","More importantly, he stressed that since he’s a professional photographer, he would need a way to organize, display and edit photography projects to promote his work.","The goal was to create a beautiful, functional website where Emeche could showcase his photography, artwork, blog and basketball journey. Seeing that he was new to website maintenance, it was also a goal of mine to make the website very easy to update as his brand gets more established.","When it came to creating the photography projects on the site, I really wanted to make it as easy as humanly possible.","Seeing that he’s also a blogger, having a well laid out display was an absolute must. I thought that by staggering the size of blog posts, it would help the reader scan blogs that they might want to read. Also, this would would very well on smaller devices.","Emeche’s new website is 100% responsive on all devices. It’s clean, professional and reflects Emeche’s personality. The focus of the new site was the blog posts so that is featured at the top of the homepage with an interesting layout to capture attention.","I’ve spoken with him since the launch and he’s glad that the photography section is super easy to add, remove and edit projects.","WordPress, Javascript, CSS",true,"Hip Hop Season is a passion project done for myself. I’m an avid listener of hip hop music, mostly non-mainstream or underground specifically. I felt the need to create this website because there isn’t enough platforms where people review non-mainstream hip hop music.","The goal was to create a website where people can go to and read long-form non-mainstream hip hop music reviews. I wanted the reviews to be straight to the point and I also wanted to build in a 100 point rating system with four review categories. Also, I wanted a good amount of white space to help the user have a pleasant reading experience.","In the end, I built a website that is 100% responsive on all devices and has a lot of white space. On each review, the first paragraph is a summary of what I thought of the project so the user gets a glimpse of what I thought before diving into the rest of the review. Also, each review has scores broken out for the four different review categories.","Being the good friend that I am, I offered to build something that would help solve these problems knowing that it would take skills that were ","JUST"," outside of my skillset.

This would have taken a Herculean effort if it was written in vanilla JavaScript.","The fact that I was building this project for someone besides myself to use, it drove me to consider much more use cases. This allowed me to focus on making the User Experience (UX) as good as possible.","I barely planned at all for this project.
