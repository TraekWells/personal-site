### Musical Escapades

I picked up and started learning the guitar during COVID and it's been one hell of journey learning this thing. It's difficult as all hell but extrememly rewarding. I started on acoustic because I love the way they sound, but finally, more than three years later, I bought an electric guitar.

The best part about it is that the sound is so much more clear so I can **really** hear how bad I am.

This past christmas, my daugher bought me a harmonica and I've been learning that as well.

I'll be playing at gigs in no time. ü•≤

### Building my brother a website

In other news, my younger brother is a talented photographer and I'm wrapping up a website for him to show off his work. This was another chance for me to use [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) and this is going to me my go-to headless CMS from now on.

After that, who knows.

### Training for a half-marathon

One of my heros David Goggins always says you should be constantly challenging yourself. My next fitness challenge is running a half-marathon and getting a PR.

## ü§î What's next?

### Probably going to re-design this website again

Because why the hell not?
